# Mirth Channels

Configuration for the Mirth system used to implement data integration between
ODK Aggregate and cims-server. It defines a process that is used to pick up data
as it is uploaded to ODK Aggregate and transfer it to cims-server using
specially designed REST endpoints. This process comprises the only linkage
between the ODK components and the rest of the CIMS system.

## Usage

To use this configuration to integrate ODK Aggregate and cims-server, follow the
[Mirth section of the general CIMS deployment
instructions](https://github.com/cims-bioko/cims-bioko.github.io/wiki/Deployment#configure-mirth).
